WHAT IS SERIALIZATION?

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store the object 
or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file. Its main purpose is to save the state of an 
object in order to be able to recreate it when needed. The reverse process is called 
deserialization.

The Java API has a mechanism to serialize objects called Object Serialization. When an object 
is serialized, information about the object including its type information as well as the 
information about the object's state is saved. After a serialized object is written into a 
file, it can be read from the file and deserialized that is, the type information and state 
of the object is recovered.

Serialization is used in RMI, EJB and JMS technologies. The serialization of an object can be 
achieved by implementing the java.io.Serializable interface. This is a marker interface which 
does not have any methods in it. The ObjectOutputStream class contains writeObject() method for 
serializing an Object.
