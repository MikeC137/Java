PRIMITIVE VS REFERENCE TYPES

STORAGE: Primitive types store actual values; reference types store references to objects.

MEMORY MANAGEMENT: Primitive types store their values directly in memory (stack) while Reference
types store references (or pointers) to their objects in memory. The actual object data is stored in the heap.

DEFAULT VALUE: Primitives have specific default values (0, false, etc.); references default to null.

METHODS: Primitives do not have methods; reference types can have methods and properties.

PERFORMANCE: Primitives are generally faster and more memory-efficient; reference types
offer more functionality and flexibility.
