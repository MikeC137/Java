WHAT ARE WRAPPER CLASSES?

Wrapper classes provide a way to use primitive data types (int, boolean, etc..) as objects. The table below shows the primitive type and the equivalent wrapper class:

Primitive Type	Wrapper Class
byte	Byte
short	Short
int	Integer
long	Long
float	Float
double	Double
boolean	Boolean
char	Character

Wrapper classes are used in situations where an object is required, such as in Java Collections Framework. For example, the add() method of the ArrayList class adds objects to the list, not primitives. If you add a primitive to an ArrayList, the compiler boxes the primitive in its wrapper class. Similarly, if you retrieve an object from the list, the compiler unboxes it from its wrapper class.
