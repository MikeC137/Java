Use If when:
- Dealing with complex conditions that require logical operators (&&, ||), ranges or other expressions that
can't be handled by a "switch" statement
- The conditions involve variables or expressions that are not constant
- Checking different variables or expressions

Use switch when:
- Dealing with multiple conditions on the same variable ( a single variable vs multiple constant values)
- Using enumerations
