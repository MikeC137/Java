UPCASTING AND DOWNCASTING

Upcasting and Downcasting are two important concepts in Java. Upcasting is casting a subclass reference to a superclass 
reference. Downcasting is casting a superclass reference to a subclass reference. Upcasting is done implicitly by the 
compiler. Downcasting is done explicitly by the programmer.
