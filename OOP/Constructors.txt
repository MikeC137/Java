CONSTRUCTORS

Constractors in Java are special methods that are used to create objects from a class. They are called when an object is created and are used to initialize the object's state. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type. They can have parameters to initialize the object with specific values.

There are two types of constructors in Java:

1. Default Constructor: A default constructor is a constructor that does not have any parameters. If a class does not have any constructors defined, Java automatically provides a default constructor that initializes the object with default values. However, if a class has at least one constructor defined, the default constructor is not provided by Java and must be defined explicitly.

2. Parameterized Constructor: A parameterized constructor is a constructor that has one or more parameters. It is used to initialize the object with specific values provided by the caller.

Overloading Constructors:

Constructors can be overloaded in Java, which means that a class can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists (different signatures). When an object is created, the appropriate constructor is called based on the arguments provided.
