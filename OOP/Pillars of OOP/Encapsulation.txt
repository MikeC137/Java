ENCAPSULATION  

The practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit
called an object. Encapsulation helps to restrict direct access some of an object's components, which can 
prevent the accidental modification of data and promote modularity and code maintainability.

Private Fields: Data within an object is typically made private or protected so that it cannot be directly
accessed or modified from outside the object.

Public Methods: Access to data is controlled through public methods (getters and setters). These methods allow
controlled access and modification of the data.

Data Hiding: Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal state of the object and only exposes what is necessary,
thus providing a clear interface and reducing the risk of unintended interference.
