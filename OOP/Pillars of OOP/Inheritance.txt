INHERITANCE

Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the properties and behavior of another class. 
It represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship. 
It is used for code reusability and method overriding. The class which inherits the properties
and behavior of another class is known as a subclass or derived class and the class whose properties
and behavior are inherited is known as a superclass or base class.

For example, a dog is an animal. Here, the dog is a subclass and animal is a superclass. 
So, the dog inherits the properties and behavior of the animal class. The dog can also have
its own properties and behavior. The dog can bark, wag its tail, etc. which are its own properties
and behavior. The dog can also inherit the properties and behavior of the animal class. 
The dog can eat, sleep, etc. which are inherited from the animal class. The dog can also
override the properties and behavior of the animal class. The dog can override the eat 
method of the animal class. The dog can eat bones, meat, etc. which are its own properties
and behavior.
