METHOD OVERLOADING VS METHOD OVERRIDING

Method Overloading: When a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, it is known as method 
overloading. It is used to increase the readability of the program. It is a compile-time polymorphism.

Method Overriding: When a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its 
superclass, it is known as method overriding. It is used to provide a specific implementation of a method that is 
already provided by its superclass. It is a runtime polymorphism.

The key differences between method overloading and method overriding are:

1. Method overloading occurs in the same class, while method overriding occurs in two classes that have an inheritance 
relationship.

2. Method overloading is achieved by changing the number of parameters or the data type of the parameters, while method overriding is achieved by changing the method implementation in the subclass.

3. Method overloading is a compile-time polymorphism, while method overriding is a runtime polymorphism.

4. Method overloading is used to increase the readability of the program, while method overriding is used to provide a specific implementation of a method.

5. Method overloading is also known as static binding, while method overriding is also known as dynamic binding.

In summary, method overloading and method overriding are two important concepts in object-oriented programming that allow for polymorphism. Method overloading is used to increase the readability of the program, while method overriding is used to provide a specific implementation of a method in a subclass.
